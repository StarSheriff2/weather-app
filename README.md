# Weather App

Weather App is a dynamic app that shows the current weather of different countries. Used JavaScript with DOM API to render and manipulate HTML. Implemented asynchrous functions and promises to access public APIs; OpenWeatherMap API to render the weather information and Unsplash API to render the background depending on the current weather.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Getting Started

**This project was created to understand more about how api worked and how to access it in JavaScript.**

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

Computer running Mac OS, Windows, or Linux Ubuntu.
Internet browser: Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera...

Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Setup

Download the code or copy the git repository to your computer.

To install dependencies you need to run the following command in your terminal.

```
  npm install
```

## Usage

Run live server extension in VSCode or run the index.html file in dist folder from the cloned repository.

### Environmental Variables

To create your own environmental variable for your API Key create a `.env` file in your root folder. Add `.env` to your gitignore as well if not added.


In your `.env` file create a variable and assign your key to it.

```
    // .env file

    API_KEY=123Abc456DefG...
    API_KEY2=123Abc456DefG...
```

To use your API key use `process.env` and attach your API variable.

```
    weatherKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

### Compile and Run

After changing the code you will need to compile your work to be able to run.

Use these scripts to compile your work.

**Build** to compile once your code.

```
    npm run build
```

**Watch** script to compile everytime you make a change, great combination with live server extension.

```
    npm run watch
```
